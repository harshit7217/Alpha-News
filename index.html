          <h2>Israel Attacks</h2>
          <div class="para">
            <p>
              Currently, tensions between Israel and Iran are high due to a
              series of missile attacks. On October 1, 2024, Iran launched over
              200 ballistic missiles targeting multiple Israeli sites, marking
              one of the largest direct assaults by Iran during the ongoing
              conflict. The strikes were part of Operation True Promise 2, which
              Iran described as retaliation for Israel's assassination of key
              leaders from Hamas and Hezbollah. While Israel intercepted most of
              the missiles, some hit areas near military bases and civilian
              locations, causing limited damage and minor injuries. The Israeli
              government has vowed a significant response, and the U.S. has
              expressed strong support for Israel, promising severe consequences
              for Iran's actionsâ€‹

              In northern Israel, the conflict with Hezbollah has also
              intensified, with Israeli ground forces engaging Hezbollah
              operatives in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military has eased
              some restrictions on gatherings in northern regions despite
              ongoing operations
